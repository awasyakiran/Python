project_1
Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are 
promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in 
recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). 
These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more 
attention to newer apps that have potential.
The task is to understand what makes an app perform well - size? price? category? multiple 
factors together? Analyze the data and present your insights in a format consumable by 
business – the final output of the analysis would be presented to business as insights with 
supporting data/visualizations
